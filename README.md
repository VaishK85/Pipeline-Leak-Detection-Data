## Project Description
This repository focuses on detecting pipeline leaks using machine learning and data analysis techniques. The project leverages EDA, feature engineering, and Random Forest modeling to uncover hidden patterns and detect leak signals in water pipeline datasets.  

The analysis is designed for industrial monitoring and preventive maintenance, helping to reduce water losses, prevent damages, and improve operational efficiency.
